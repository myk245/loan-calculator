# Loan-Calculator

An application that makes it easy to make important calculations on your loans so that you know how much you will owe in total and how much interest you will be charged.

## Calculations

It's as easy as entering a loan amount, the interest rate, and the number of years to repay, and pressing "calculate". Loan-Calculator will then break down your monthly payment amount, the total payment amount, and the total interest.
